Orignal README:

# Dragonspeak

Dragonspeak is a Minecraft resource pack for [Wings of Fire: The New World](https://woftnw.org). It was originally created by Stonley890 and Starinquirer and is now maintained by the WOFTNW staff team. It's primary feature is its collection of custom wings, but it also has smaller WOF-inspired changes as well as ability icons for [Elytras of Fire](https://github.com/iHeronGH/Elytras-of-Fire). You can read more about Dragonspeak on the [WOFTNW Wiki](https://wiki.woftnw.org/wiki/Dragonspeak).
